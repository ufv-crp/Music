This project was built in a modularized way, this means that this is the front-end and the back-end is in a separete [project](https://github.com/Sphinxs/Graph). Access the Graphql API [project](https://github.com/Sphinxs/Graph) to set the API.

#### Deploy

This project can be deployed of different ways: using Docker or Docker Compose, generating a build and serving it through NGINX, Traefik or any other proxy  / server and using PM2 by installing it `yarn global add pmp`, generating a build and starting the service `pm2 start application.config.json`; or just `export PORT=4000 && pm2 start node_modules/react-scripts/scripts/start.js --name "music"`.

#### Collections

Collections can be found in the [Graphql API](https://github.com/Sphinxs/Graph/tree/master/collections) project, to test the API, besides the interface implemented here.

#### Debug

To debug this project, you can use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql). To understand the schema, you can use the [GraphQL Editor](https://app.graphqleditor.com/grapher/grapher).

To understand the state you can use the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi), once the state is built using the React context native API - change the `encryptLocalStorage = true` to `false` at the _src/states/utils.js_ to see the state persisted at the local storage.

#### Style

This project follow the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) guide lines.

#### Publication

This project was developed as an extension project at the Federal University of Vi√ßosa and published in the [UFG Journal](https://www.revistas.ufg.br/revistaufg). The article is available [here](https://www.revistas.ufg.br/revistaufg/article/view/60606/34032). The API intends to be a reusable project, while the front-end attend the requirements of a specific school, but can also be reusable.
